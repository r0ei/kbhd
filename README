KBHD (Keyboard Handler)
============

This module works simply by registering an IRQ handler, reading the keyboard port (0x60 in our case),
translating the result scancode into ascii value then saving it for use in the ``/proc`` entry.

NOTE: This module is very platform-specific, meaning it might not work in some platforms. The module behavior might be affected by the OS, IRQ system, kernel version and by the keyboard layout.
All tests were performed with Light-Ubuntu, kernel ``5.13.0-40-generic``, IRQ number (1) and Qwerty keyboard layout.

In order to build the module, use ``make all``.
This module supports debugging, which just writes log info into the kernel ring buffer. 
To enable debugging, use ``insmod kbhd.ko DEBUG=1``.

If you find an issue in the program, I will appreciate if you open an issue explaining the issue in substencial way so I can address and fix it. New ideas and any kind of improvements are always welcome, please submit a PR if you think your idea fits this program.
